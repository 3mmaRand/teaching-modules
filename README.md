# Package Development Modules
Forwards Package Development organised into modules to increase our ability to deliver face-to-face and online workshops of different lengths, and with different emphases, whilst retaining consistency.

## Context
The Forwards task force works to increase the representation of groups currently underrepresented in the R Community. The Teaching Team subgroup develops teaching methodology and materials and provides workshops in support of this work. Until now, workshops have been face-to-face, usually approximately one day long. This limits our reach because only those with access to teaching facilities can deliver teaching and only those able to attned face to face workshops can benefit from it. In addition, the need to adapt materials to workshops of varying lengths means we have several copies of material and inconsistencies can arise. 

## Aims
To modularise Forwards Package Development materials to increase our ability to deliver face-to-face and online workshops of different lengths, and with different emphases, whilst retaining consistency.

## Guiding principles

The collection of modules should be:  
* reviewed annually by the Teaching Team  
* stackable with suggested curricula for workshops of different lengths  
* be branded as by Forwards Teaching Team  
* be accompanied by a glossary  
* surveys which are also organised as common front question plus module specific  

A module should:  
* be approximately 1hr. Structured. Possibly:
  * 00 - 0: 10 min Introduction  
    * Overview of curriculum  
    * Overview of module  
    * Prerequisites  
    * Learning Objectives for module  
  * 10 - 25: 15 min Block 1: Live code-along-coding  
  * 25 - 30: 05 min additional exercises based on Block 1  
  * 30 - 45: 15 min Block 2: Live code-along-coding  
  * 45 - 50: 05 min additional exercises based on Block 2  
  * 50 - 55 Wrap-up, where next, additional exercises  
* be discrete (standalone) but link to other modules  
* have specified prerequisites (skills and set up) and learning objectives  
* be a complete resource for teaching (a person should be able to teach   themselves from the material) and include tutor notes  
* have a maintainer; maintenance of a module should not be too onerous.   
* include a “last updated”  
* have a doi  
* have a set of Rmd slides with speaker notes; each slide has minimal content but speaker notes are detailed  
* use live coding, (minimise ‘lecturing’); include additional exercises for the speedy  
* use one example package, (that we make) all the way through rather than switching  between creating mypackage, mylittlepony, add_cols. Cf “the whole game”
